=== Features & Limitations ===

The output refers to quadrants and roads with numbers. Bellow is legend/key of the system we use.

  * Quadrant Map:
  *     North (2)
  *    --------------
  * W |      |       | E
  * E |   2  |   1   | A
  * S |      |       | S
  * T  --------------  T
  * ( |      |       | (
  * 3 |  3   |   4   | 1
  * ) |      |       | )
  *    --------------
  *     South (4)

This system assigns the quadrant numbers that may be familiar from elementary graphs, and assigns the number of a road based off of the first quadrant that a car would move into if coming from that road.
