=== Project Structure ===

The following files are a part of the project:

- Makefile
- main.c (contains the source code for the pirates vs ninja simulation)
- problem1_explanation.txt (contains our explanation for problem 1)
- pvn (WILL NOT BE IN THE ZIP FILE, WILL BE COMPILED BY END USER)

=== Compiling ===

There is an included Makefile. To compile the pvn executable, run:

$ make

To delete the generated files, run

$ make clean

NOTICE:

Compiling into a 32 bit executable is being forced with the -m32 flag in the make file. This is to simulate the environment of the virtual machine if compiling outside the classroom VM. Of course, this program is still being tested on the classroom VM.

=== Running ===

In order to run the executable, run

$ ./pvn <numCostumingTeams> <numPirates> <numNinjas> <avgCostumingTimePirate> <avgCostumingTimeNinja> <avgArrivalTimePirate> <avgArrivalTimeNinja>

Where all of the arguments are numbers. The details for each parameter are below:

- numCostumingTeams

	Must be an integer from 2 to 4 (inclusive). Dictates the number of costuming teams in the simulation.

- numPirates

	Must be an integer from 10 to 50 (inclusive). Dictates the number of pirates in the simulation.

- numNinjas

	Must be an integer from 10 to 50 (inclusive). Dictates the number of ninjas in the simulation.

- avgCostumingTimePirate

	Must be an integer. Dictates the amount of time (in execution seconds) that a pirate will spend in the costume shop.

- avgCostumingTimeNinja

	Must be an integer. Dictates the amount of time (in execution seconds) that a ninja will spend in the costume shop.

- avgArrivalTimePirate

	Must be an integer. Dictates the amount of time (in execution seconds) that a pirate will spend adventuring before visiting the costuming department.

- avgArrivalTimeNinja

	Must be an integer. Dictates the amount of time (in execution seconds) that a ninja will spend adventuring before visiting the costuming department.

The below is a valid set of arguments

$ ./pvn 4 50 50 10 10 5 5

=== Features & Limitations ===

=== Tests ===

Output files of what one should expect when running the program are included.

The result of running $ ./pvn 4 50 50 10 10 10 10 is stored at output.txt

The result of running $ ./pvn 4 50 50 15 30 10 10 is stored at output2.txt
