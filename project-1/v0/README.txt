=== Compiling ===

There is an included Makefile, but you can also run the following commands

$ gcc main.c -o mc0

To compile the program with the Makefile, run

$ make

We also support ($ make all), but it's no different than the previous commands.

Running ($ make clean) will delete the mc2 executable that was compiled.

=== Running ===

You can run the program with

$ ./mc0

=== Limitations ===

There are currently no limitations that are not present in the spec sheet for the assignment.
